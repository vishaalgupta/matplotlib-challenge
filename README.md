# I started by merging the Mouse data and the Study Results data based on Mouse ID. I then cleaned the data by removing mice that had duplicate data
# I calculatd summary statistics for the average tumor volume based on the drug each mouse received. 
# I created a bar graph showing how many mice were tested for each drug regimen and a pie chart showing the gender split amongst the mice.
# I calculated the final tumor volume for mice using "Capomulin", "Ramicane", "Infubinol", or "Ceftamin" and then determined if there were any outliers. I plotted the data for each of the drugs using boxplots
# I created a line graph showing the results of 'Capomulin' on mouse l509 and a scatterplot showing the correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume.
